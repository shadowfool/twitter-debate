After great pain, a formal feeling comes – 
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs – 
The stiff Heart questions ‘was it He, that bore,’ 
And ‘Yesterday, or Centuries before’? 

The Feet, mechanical, go round – 
A Wooden way 
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought – 
Regardless grown, 
A Quartz contentment, like a stone – 

This is the Hour of Lead – 
Remembered, if outlived, 
As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow – 
First – Chill – then Stupor – then the letting go –

Because I could not stop for Death – 
He kindly stopped for me – 
The Carriage held but just Ourselves – 
And Immortality. 

We slowly drove – He knew no haste 
And I had put away 
My labor and my leisure too, 
For His Civility – 

We passed the School, where Children strove 
At Recess – in the Ring – 
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain – 
We passed the Setting Sun – 

Or rather – He passed Us – 
The Dews drew quivering and Chill – 
For only Gossamer, my Gown – 
My Tippet – only Tulle – 

We paused before a House that seemed 
A Swelling of the Ground – 
The Roof was scarcely visible – 
The Cornice – in the Ground – 

Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet 
Feels shorter than the Day 
I first surmised the Horses' Heads 
Were toward Eternity –


A Bird, came down the Walk - 
He did not know I saw -
He bit an Angle Worm in halves 
And ate the fellow, raw, 
 
And then, he drank a Dew
From a convenient Grass -
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall 
To let a Beetle pass -
 
He glanced with rapid eyes,
That hurried all abroad -
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought,
He stirred his Velvet Head. - 
 
Like one in danger, Cautious,
I offered him a Crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers, 
And rowed him softer Home -
 
Than Oars divide the Ocean,
Too silver for a seam,
Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon, 
Leap, plashless as they swim. 

“Hope” is the thing with feathers - 
That perches in the soul - 
And sings the tune without the words - 
And never stops - at all - 

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard - 

And sore must be the storm - 
That could abash the little Bird 
That kept so many warm - 

I’ve heard it in the chillest land - 
And on the strangest Sea - 
Yet - never - in Extremity, 
It asked a crumb - of me.

I dwell in Possibility – 
A fairer House than Prose – 
More numerous of Windows – 
Superior – for Doors – 

Of Chambers as the Cedars – 
Impregnable of eye – 
And for an everlasting Roof 
The Gambrels of the Sky – 

Of Visitors – the fairest – 
For Occupation – This – 
The spreading wide my narrow Hands 
To gather Paradise –

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, 
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading - treading - till it seemed 
That Sense was breaking through - 

And when they all were seated, 
A Service, like a Drum -
Kept beating - beating - till I thought 
My mind was going numb - 

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul 
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space - began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell, 
And Being, but an Ear, 
And I, and Silence, some strange Race, 
Wrecked, solitary, here -

And then a Plank in Reason, broke, 
And I dropped down, and down - 
And hit a World, at every plunge, 
And Finished knowing - then -


I heard a Fly buzz - when I died -
The Stillness in the Room 
Was like the Stillness in the Air -
Between the Heaves of Storm - 

The Eyes around - had wrung them dry - 
And Breaths were gathering firm 
For that last Onset - when the King 
Be witnessed - in the Room -

I willed my Keepsakes - Signed away 
What portion of me be 
Assignable - and then it was 
There interposed a Fly - 

With Blue - uncertain - stumbling Buzz -
Between the light - and me -
And then the Windows failed - and then 
I could not see to see -

My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun - 
In Corners - till a Day 
The Owner passed - identified -
And carried Me away -

And now We roam in Sovreign Woods -
And now We hunt the Doe -
And every time I speak for Him
The Mountains straight reply -

And do I smile, such cordial light
Opon the Valley glow -
It is as a Vesuvian face
Had let it’s pleasure through -

And when at Night - Our good Day done -
I guard My Master’s Head -
’Tis better than the Eider Duck’s
Deep Pillow - to have shared -

To foe of His - I’m deadly foe -
None stir the second time -
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye -
Or an emphatic Thumb -

Though I than He - may longer live
He longer must - than I -
For I have but the power to kill,
Without - the power to die -






















1 
Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face! 
Clouds of the west—sun there half an hour high—I see you also face to face. 

Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are to me! 
On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home, are more curious to me than you suppose, 
And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose. 

2 
The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day, 
The simple, compact, well-join’d scheme, myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme, 
The similitudes of the past and those of the future, 
The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the river, 
The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away, 
The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them, 
The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others. 

Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore, 
Others will watch the run of the flood-tide, 
Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east, 
Others will see the islands large and small; 
Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high, 
A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them, 
Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide. 

3 
It avails not, time nor place—distance avails not, 
I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence, 
Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt, 
Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd, 
Just as you are refresh’d by the gladness of the river and the bright flow, I was refresh’d, 
Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, I stood yet was hurried, 
Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick-stemm’d pipes of steamboats, I look’d. 

I too many and many a time cross’d the river of old, 
Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies, 
Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow, 
Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south, 
Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water, 
Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams, 
Look’d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water, 
Look’d on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward, 
Look’d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet, 
Look’d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving, 
Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me, 
Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor, 
The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars, 
The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine pennants, 
The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot-houses, 
The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels, 
The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset, 
The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and glistening, 
The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks, 
On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank’d on each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter, 
On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night, 
Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets. 

4 
These and all else were to me the same as they are to you, 
I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river, 
The men and women I saw were all near to me, 
Others the same—others who look back on me because I look’d forward to them, 
(The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.) 

5 
What is it then between us? 
What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us? 

Whatever it is, it avails not—distance avails not, and place avails not, 
I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine, 
I too walk’d the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the waters around it, 
I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me, 
In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me, 
In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me, 
I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution, 
I too had receiv’d identity by my body, 
That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I should be of my body. 

6 
It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall, 
The dark threw its patches down upon me also, 
The best I had done seem’d to me blank and suspicious, 
My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre? 
Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil, 
I am he who knew what it was to be evil, 
I too knitted the old knot of contrariety, 
Blabb’d, blush’d, resented, lied, stole, grudg’d, 
Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak, 
Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant, 
The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me, 
The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting, 
Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting, 
Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest, 
Was call’d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing, 
Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as I sat, 
Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a word, 
Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, 

Play’d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, 
The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, 
Or as small as we like, or both great and small. 

7 
Closer yet I approach you, 
What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you—I laid in my stores in advance, 
I consider’d long and seriously of you before you were born. 

Who was to know what should come home to me? 
Who knows but I am enjoying this? 
Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see me? 

8 
Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast-hemm’d Manhattan? 
River and sunset and scallop-edg’d waves of flood-tide? 
The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight, and the belated lighter?

What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as I approach? 
What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face? 
Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you? 

We understand then do we not? 
What I promis’d without mentioning it, have you not accepted? 
What the study could not teach—what the preaching could not accomplish is accomplish’d, is it not? 

9 
Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide! 
Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg’d waves! 
Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the men and women generations after me! 
Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers! 
Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn! 
Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers! 
Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution! 
Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly! 

Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my nighest name! 
Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress! 
Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one makes it! 
Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon you; 
Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste with the hasting current; 
Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air; 
Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all downcast eyes have time to take it from you! 
Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any one’s head, in the sunlit water! 
Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail’d schooners, sloops, lighters! 
Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower’d at sunset! 
Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses! 

Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are, 
You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul, 
About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung out divinest aromas, 
Thrive, cities—bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient rivers, 
Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual, 
Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting. 

You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers, 
We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward, 
Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us, 
We use you, and do not cast you aside—we plant you permanently within us, 
We fathom you not—we love you—there is perfection in you also, 
You furnish your parts toward eternity, 
Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.


1 
I sing the body electric, 
The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them, 
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, 
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul. 

Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves? 
And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? 
And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul? 
And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul? 

2 
The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account, 
That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect. 

The expression of the face balks account, 
But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, 
It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, 
It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him, 
The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth, 
To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more, 
You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side. 

The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, 
The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water, 
The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle, 
Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, 
The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting, 
The female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard, 
The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd, 
The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work, 
The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, 
The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes; 
The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, 
The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, 
The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting; 
Such-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child, 
Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count. 

3 
I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons, 
And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons. 

This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person, 
The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners, 
These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also, 
He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome, 
They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him, 
They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love, 
He drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face, 
He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him, 
When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang, 
You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other. 

4 
I have perceiv’d that to be with those I like is enough, 
To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough, 
To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, 
To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then? 
I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea. 

There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well, 
All things please the soul, but these please the soul well. 

5 
This is the female form, 
A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot, 
It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, 
I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, 
Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed, 
Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable, 
Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused, 
Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching, 
Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice, 
Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn, 
Undulating into the willing and yielding day, 
Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day. 

This the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman, 
This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. 

Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest, 
You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. 

The female contains all qualities and tempers them, 
She is in her place and moves with perfect balance, 
She is all things duly veil’d, she is both passive and active, 
She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. 

As I see my soul reflected in Nature, 
As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty, 
See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see. 

6 
The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place, 
He too is all qualities, he is action and power, 
The flush of the known universe is in him, 
Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well, 
The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him, 
The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul, 
Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself, 
Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here, 
(Where else does he strike soundings except here?) 

The man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred, 
No matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers’ gang? 
Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf? 
Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you, 
Each has his or her place in the procession. 

(All is a procession, 
The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.) 

Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant? 
Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight? 
Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts, 
For you only, and not for him and her? 

7 
A man’s body at auction, 
(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,) 
I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business. 

Gentlemen look on this wonder, 
Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it, 
For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant, 
For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll’d. 

In this head the all-baffling brain, 
In it and below it the makings of heroes. 

Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve, 
They shall be stript that you may see them. 

Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, 
Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs, 
And wonders within there yet. 

Within there runs blood, 
The same old blood! the same red-running blood! 
There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations, 
(Do you think they are not there because they are not express’d in parlors and lecture-rooms?) 

This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns, 
In him the start of populous states and rich republics, 
Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments. 

How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries? 
(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?) 

8 
A woman’s body at auction, 
She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers, 
She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers. 

Have you ever loved the body of a woman? 
Have you ever loved the body of a man? 
Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth? 

If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred, 
And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted, 
And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face. 

Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body? 
For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves. 

9 
O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you, 
I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul, (and that they are the soul,) 
I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and that they are my poems, 
Man’s, woman’s, child’s, youth’s, wife’s, husband’s, mother’s, father’s, young man’s, young woman’s poems, 
Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears, 
Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids, 
Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges, 
Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, 
Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue, 
Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the chest, 
Upper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones, 
Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger, finger-joints, finger-nails, 
Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side, 
Ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone, 
Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root, 
Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above, 
Leg fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg, 
Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel; 
All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body or of any one’s body, male or female, 
The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean, 
The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame, 
Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity, 
Womanhood, and all that is a woman, and the man that comes from woman, 
The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and risings, 
The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud, 
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming, 
Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening, 
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes, 
The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair, 
The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body, 
The circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out, 
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees, 
The thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the marrow in the bones, 
The exquisite realization of health; 
O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul, 
O I say now these are the soul!
